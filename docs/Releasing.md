Releasing ShopifyApp

1. Check the Semantic Versioning page for info on how to version the new release: http://semver.org
2. Create a pull request with the following changes:
  * Update the version of ShopifyApp in lib/shopify_app/version.rb
  * Add a CHANGELOG entry for the new release with the date
  * Change the title of the PR to something like: "Packaging for release X.Y.Z"
3. Merge your pull request
4. Pull from master so you have the latest version of the shopify_app
5. Tag the HEAD with the version (Leave REV blank for HEAD or provide a SHA)
  $ git tag vX.Y.Z
6. Push out your tags
  $ git push --tags
7. Use Shipit to build and push the gem

If you see an error like 'You need to create the vX.Y.X tag first', clear GIT
cache in Shipit settings
