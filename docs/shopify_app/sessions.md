## Sessions
#### Types of session tokens
- **Shop** ([offline access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#offline-access))
  - Access token is linked to the store
  - Meant for long-term access to a store, where no user interaction is involved
  - Ideal for background jobs or maintenance work
- **User** ([online access](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes#online-access))
  - Access token is linked to an individual user on a store
  - Meant to be used when a user is interacting with your app through the web

⚠️  [Read more about Online vs. Offline access here](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth/access-modes).

#### Session token storage
##### Shop (offline) token storage
⚠️ All apps must have a shop session storage, if you started from the [Ruby App Template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-ruby), it's already configured to have a Shop model by default.

If you don't already have a repository to store the access tokens:

1. Run the following generator to create a shop model to store the access tokens

```sh
rails generate shopify_app:shop_model
```

2. Configure `config/initializers/shopify_app.rb` to enable shop session token persistance:

```ruby
config.shop_session_repository = 'Shop'
```

##### User (online) token storage
If your app has user interactions and would like to control permission based on individual users, you need to configure a User token storage to persist unique tokens for each user.

[Shop (offline) tokens must still be maintained](#shop-offline-token-storage).

1. Run the following generator to create a user model to store the individual based access tokens
```sh
rails generate shopify_app:user_model
```

2. Configure `config/initializers/shopify_app.rb` to enable user session token persistance:

```ruby
config.user_session_repository = 'User'
```

The current Shopify user will be stored in the rails session at `session[:shopify_user]`

##### In-memory Session Storage for testing
The `ShopifyApp` gem includes methods for in-memory storage for both shop and user sessions. In-memory storage is intended to be used in a testing environment, please use a persistent storage for your application.
- [InMemoryShopSessionStore](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/in_memory_shop_session_store.rb)
- [InMemoryUserSessionStore](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/in_memory_user_session_store.rb)

You can configure the `ShopifyApp` configuration to use the in-memory storage method during manual testing:
```ruby
# config/initializers/shopify_app.rb

config.shop_session_repository = ShopifyApp::InMemoryShopSessionStore
config.user_session_repository = ShopifyApp::InMemoryUserSessionStore
```

##### Customizing Session Storage with `ShopifyApp::SessionRepository`

In the rare event that you would like to break Rails convention for storing/retrieving records, the `ShopifyApp::SessionRepository` allows you to define how your sessions are stored and retrieved for shops. The specific repository for `shop` & `user` is configured in the `config/initializers/shopify_app.rb` file and can be set to any object.

```ruby
# config/initializers/shopify_app.rb

config.shop_session_repository = MyCustomShopSessionRepository
config.user_session_repository = MyCustomUserSessionRepository
```

##### ⚠️  Custom Session Storage Requirements

The custom **Shop** repository must implement the following methods:

| Method                                            | Parameters                                 | Return Type               |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `self.store(auth_session)`                        | `auth_session` (ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session) | -                         |
| `self.retrieve(id)`                               | `id` (String)                              | ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session |
| `self.retrieve_by_shopify_domain(shopify_domain)` | `shopify_domain` (String)                  | ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session |

The custom **User** repository must implement the following methods:
| Method                                      | Parameters                          | Return Type                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `self.store(auth_session, user)`            | <li>`auth_session` (ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session)<br><li>`user` (ShopifyAPI::Auth::AssociatedUser) | - |
| `self.retrieve(id)`                         | `id` (String)                       | `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session`  |
| `self.retrieve_by_shopify_user_id(user_id)` | `user_id` (String)                  | `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Session`  |


These methods are already implemented as a part of the `User` and `Shop` models generated from this gem's generator.
- `Shop` model includes the [ShopSessionStorageWithScopes](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/shop_session_storage_with_scopes.rb) concern.
- `User` model includes the [UserSessionStorageWithScopes](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/user_session_storage_with_scopes.rb) concern.

##### Available `ActiveSupport::Concerns` that contains implementation of the above methods
Simply include these concerns if you want to use the implementation, and overwrite methods for custom implementation

- `Shop` storage
  - [ShopSessionStorageWithScopes](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/shop_session_storage_with_scopes.rb)
  - [ShopSessionStorage](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/shop_session_storage.rb)

- `User` storage
  - [UserSessionStorageWithScopes](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/user_session_storage_with_scopes.rb)
  - [UserSessionStorage](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/user_session_storage.rb)

### Loading Sessions
By using the appropriate controller concern, sessions are loaded for you.

#### Getting Sessions with Controller Concerns

⚠️  **Note: These controller concerns cannot both be included in the same controller.**
##### **Shop Sessions - `EnsureInstalled`**
- [EnsureInstalled](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb) controller concern will load a shop session with the `installed_shop_session` helper. If a shop session is not found, meaning the app wasn't installed for this shop, the request will be redirected to be installed.
- This controller concern should NOT be used if you don't need your app to make calls on behalf of a user.
- Example
```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
  include ShopifyApp::EnsureInstalled

  def method
    current_session = installed_shop_session # `installed_shop_session` is a helper from `EnsureInstalled`

    client = ShopifyAPI::Clients::Graphql::Admin.new(session: current_session)
    client.query(
    #...
    )
  end
end
```

##### User Sessions - `EnsureHasSession`
- [EnsureHasSession](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_has_session.rb) controller concern will load a user session via `current_shopify_session`. As part of loading this session, this concern will also ensure that the user session has the appropriate scopes needed for the application. If the user isn't found or has fewer permitted scopes than are required, they will be prompted to authorize the application.
- This controller concern should be used if you don't need your app to make calls on behalf of a user. With that in mind, there are a few other embedded concerns that are mixed in to ensure that embedding, CSRF, localization, and billing allow the action for the user.
- Example
```ruby
class MyController < ApplicationController
  include ShopifyApp::EnsureHasSession

  def method
    current_session = current_shopify_session # `current_shopify_session` is a helper from `EnsureHasSession`

    client = ShopifyAPI::Clients::Graphql::Admin.new(session: current_session)
    client.query(
    #...
    )
  end
end
```

#### Getting sessions from a Shop or User model record - 'with_shopify_session'
The [ShopifyApp::SessionStorage#with_shopify_session](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/session_storage.rb#L12)
helper allows you to make API calls within the context of a user or shop, by using that record's access token.

This mixin is already included in ActiveSupport [concerns](#available-activesupportconcerns-that-contains-implementation-of-the-above-methods) from this gem.
If you're using a custom implementation of session storage, you can include the [ShopifyApp::SessionStorage](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/session_storage.rb) concern.

All calls made within the block passed into this helper will be made in that context:

```ruby
# To use shop context for "my_shopify_domain.myshopify.com"
shopify_domain = "my_shopify_domain.myshopify.com"
shop = Shop.find_by(shopify_domain: shopify_domain)
shop.with_shopify_session do
  ShopifyAPI::Product.find(id: product_id)
  # This will call the Shopify API with my_shopify_domain's access token
end

# To use user context for user ID "my_user_id"
user = User.find_by(shopify_user_id: "my_user_id")
user.with_shopify_session do
  ShopifyAPI::Product.find(id: product_id)
  # This will call the Shopify API with my_user_id's access token
end
```

## Access scopes
If you want to customize how access scopes are stored for shops and users, you can implement the `access_scopes` getters and setters in the models that include `ShopifyApp::ShopSessionStorageWithScopes` and `ShopifyApp::UserSessionStorageWithScopes` as shown:

### `ShopifyApp::ShopSessionStorageWithScopes`
```ruby
class Shop < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ShopifyApp::ShopSessionStorageWithScopes

  def access_scopes=(scopes)
    # Store access scopes
  end
  def access_scopes
    # Find access scopes
  end
end
```

### `ShopifyApp::UserSessionStorageWithScopes`
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ShopifyApp::UserSessionStorageWithScopes

  def access_scopes=(scopes)
    # Store access scopes
  end
  def access_scopes
    # Find access scopes
  end
end
```

## Migrating from shop-based to user-based token strategy

1. Run the `user_model` generator as [mentioned above](#user-online-token-storage).
2. Ensure that both your `Shop` model and `User` model includes the [necessary concerns](#available-activesupportconcerns-that-contains-implementation-of-the-above-methods)
3. Update the configuration file to use the new session storage.

```ruby
# config/initializers/shopify_app.rb

config.shop_session_repository = {YOUR_SHOP_MODEL_CLASS}
config.user_session_repository = {YOUR_USER_MODEL_CLASS}
```

## Migrating from `ShopifyApi::Auth::SessionStorage` to `ShopifyApp::SessionStorage`
- Support for using `ShopifyApi::Auth::SessionStorage` was removed from ShopifyApi [version 13.0.0](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-ruby/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1300)
- Sessions storage are now handled with [ShopifyApp::SessionRepository](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/main/lib/shopify_app/session/session_repository.rb)
- To migrate and specify your shop or user session storage method:
  1. Remove `session_storage` configuration from `config/initializers/shopify_app.rb`
  2. Follow ["Session Token Storage" instructions](#session-token-storage) to specify the storage repository for shop and user sessions.
