## Introduction

This gem includes a Rails engine, generators, modules, and mixins that help create Rails applications that work with Shopify APIs. The [Shopify App Rails engine](/docs/shopify_app/engine.md) provides all the code required to implement OAuth with Shopify. The [default Shopify App generator](/docs/shopify_app/generators.md#-environment-rails-generate-shopify_app) builds an app that can be embedded in the Shopify Admin and secures it with [session tokens](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps/building-embedded-apps-using-session-tokens).

<!-- This section is linked to in `templates/shopify_app.rb.tt`. Be careful renaming this heading. -->
## Requirements

> **Rails compatibility** 
> * Rails 6.1 or above is not yet supported due to the new `cookies_same_site_protection` setting. 
> * Use Shopify App `<= v7.2.8` if you need to work with Rails 4.

To become a Shopify app developer, you will need a [Shopify Partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account. Explore the [Shopify dev docs](https://shopify.dev/concepts/shopify-introduction) to learn more about [building Shopify apps](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps).

This gem requires that you have the following credentials:

- **Shopify API key:** The API key app credential specified in your [Shopify Partners dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/organizations). 
- **Shopify API secret:** The API secret key app credential specified in your [Shopify Partners dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/organizations). 

## Usage

1. To get started, create a new Rails app:

``` sh
$ rails new my_shopify_app
```

2. Add the Shopify App gem to `my_shopify_app`'s Gemfile.

```sh
$ bundle add shopify_app
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of `my_shopify_app` to specify your Shopify API credentials:

```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=<Your Shopify API key>
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=<Your Shopify API secret>
```

> In a development environment, you can use a gem like `dotenv-rails` to manage environment variables. 

4. Run the default Shopify App generator to create an app that can be embedded in the Shopify Admin:

```sh
$ rails generate shopify_app
```

5. Run a migration to create the necessary tables in your database:

```sh
$ rails db:migrate
```

6. Run the app:

```sh
$ rails server
```

See [*Quickstart*](/docs/Quickstart.md) to learn how to install your app on a shop.

This app implements [OAuth 2.0](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/authenticate-with-oauth) with Shopify to authenticate requests made to Shopify APIs. By default, this app is configured to use [session tokens](https://shopify.dev/concepts/apps/building-embedded-apps-using-session-tokens) to authenticate merchants when embedded in the Shopify Admin.

See [*Generators*](/docs/shopify_app/generators.md) for a complete list of generators available to Shopify App.

### Engine

Mounting the Shopify App Rails Engine provides the following routes. These routes are configured to help install your application on shops and implement OAuth.

| Verb   | Route                    | Action             |
|   ---: | :---                     | :---               |
| `GET`  | `/login`                 | Login              |
| `POST` | `/login`                 | Login              |
| `GET`  | `/auth/shopify/callback` | OAuth redirect URI |
| `GET`  | `/logout`                | Logout             |
| `POST` | `/webhooks/:type`        | Webhook callback   |

These routes are configurable. See the more detailed [*Engine*](/docs/shopify_app/engine.md) documentation to learn how you can customize the login URL or mount the Shopify App Rails engine at nested routes.

To learn more about how this gem authenticates with Shopify, see [*Authentication*](/docs/shopify_app/authentication.md).

### API Versioning

[Shopify's API is versioned](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/versioning). With Shopify App `v1.11.0`, the included Shopify API gem allows developers to specify and update the Shopify API version they want their app or service to use. The Shopify API gem also surfaces warnings to Rails apps about [deprecated endpoints, GraphQL fields and more](https://shopify.dev/concepts/about-apis/versioning#deprecation-practices).

See the [Shopify API gem README](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_api/) for more information.
