* Update README to clarify nested routes

  * Webhook payloads, from Shopify for API version 2019-07, which are processed in ActiveJob background jobs (the
    default behaviour of shopify_app's WebhooksController) are compatible, due to how ActiveJob versions prior to
    5.2.1.1 process GlobalIDs encoded as string in job parameters. This prevents the
    [exceptions reported previously](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/issues/600).

* Add support for per_user_authentication
* Pass the shop param in the session for authentication instead of a url param (prevents csrf). If you are upgrading from an older version of the gem you will need to update your omniauth.rb initializer file. Check the example app for what it what it should look like.

8.0.0
-----
Known bug: Shop logged out when submitting a form for 'Shop' objects, fixed in 8.2.1 [[See #480 for details]](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/issues/480)

* Removed the `shopify_session_repository` initializer. The SessionRepository is now configured through the main ShopifyApp configuration object and the generated initializer

* Changed engine controllers to subclass ActionController::Base to avoid any possible conflict with the parent application
* Removed the `ShopifyApp::Shop` concern and added its methods to `ShopifyApp::SessionStorage`. To update for this change just remove this concern anywhere it is being used in your application.

* Add webhooks to generated home controller. This should help new users debug issues.
