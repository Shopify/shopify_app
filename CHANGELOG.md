-----
Known bug: Shop logged out when submitting a form for 'Shop' objects, fixed in 8.2.1 [[See #480 for details]](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/issues/480)

* Removed the `shopify_session_repository` initializer. The SessionRepository is now configured through the main ShopifyApp configuration object and the generated initializer
* Moved InMemorySessionStore into the ShopifyApp namespace
* Remove ShopifySession concern. This module made the code internal to this engine harder to follow and we want to discourage over-writing the auth code now that we have generic hooks for all extra tasks during install.
* Changed engine controllers to subclass ActionController::Base to avoid any possible conflict with the parent application
* Removed the `ShopifyApp::Shop` concern and added its methods to `ShopifyApp::SessionStorage`. To update for this change just remove this concern anywhere it is being used in your application.
* Add `ShopifyApp::EmbeddedApp` controller concern which handles setting the required headers for the ESDK. Previously this was done by injecting configuration into applicaton.rb which affects the entire app.
* Add webhooks to generated home controller. This should help new users debug issues.
