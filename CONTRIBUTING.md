## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the Shopify App gem. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before submitting a bug report

* **Check the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/Troubleshooting.md).** You may be able to troubleshoot the issue you're facing.
* **Check the [Shopify Community links](#shopify-community-forum-links) to search for your issue.** This problem may have been reported before and solved on the Shopify forum.
* **Perform a cursory search for similar issues.** You may find that the same problem (or a similar one) has been filed already as an issue.

#### How do I submit a good bug report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the [bug-report template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** where possible.
* **Redact any private information** from your logs and issue description. This includes things like API keys, API secrets, and any access tokens.

### Suggesting or requesting improvements

If you have a suggestion for the Shopify App gem or a feature request, provide the appropriate information by filling out the [feature-request template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md).

### Pull requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain the Shopify App gem's quality
* Fix problems that are important to app developers
* Enable a sustainable system for the Shopify App gem's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

* Follow all instructions in the [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing
  * <details>
      <summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>

      While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
