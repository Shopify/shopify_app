= Shopify application generator for Rails 3.2

== Description

This gem makes it easy to get a Rails 3.2 app up and running with the
Shopify API.

The generator creates a basic login controller for authenticating with your
shop and a HomeController which displays basic information about your
products, orders and articles.

<i>Note: It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the
generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.</i>

== Installation

    # Add the gem shopify_app to your Gemfile
    $ echo "gem 'shopify_app'" >> Gemfile
    $ bundle install

== Usage

    $ rails generate shopify_app your_app_api_key your_app_secret

If you don't have an API key yet, create a Shopify Partner account at
http://shopify.com/partners and create an app. You can also create test shops
once you're logged in as a partner.

When you create your app in the Shopify Partner Account, set the return URL to
<tt>http://localhost:3000/login/finalize</tt>

You can also create a private application that only works for your shop by
visiting https://YOUR-SHOP.myshopify.com/admin/api

=== Example

    $ rails generate shopify_app edffbb1bb793e2750686e6f4647a384a fed5bb18hde3e2750686e6f4647a781a

This will create a LoginController and a HomeController with their own views.

== After running the generator

First, start your application:

    $ rails server

Now visit http://localhost:3000 and install your application in a Shopify store.

After your application has been given read or read/write API permission by the
shop, you're ready to start experimenting with the Shopify API.

To configure which permissions are given to your app. First, review the documentation on scopes http://api.shopify.com/authentication.html. Then, add a scope line to config/initializers/omniauth.rb file.

Example requesting access to a shop with write access to products and read access to orders:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
        provider :shopify, 
           ShopifyApp.configuration.api_key, 
           ShopifyApp.configuration.secret,
           :scope => "write_products,read_orders",
           :setup => lambda {|env| 
                       params = Rack::Utils.parse_query(env['QUERY_STRING'])
                       site_url = "https://#{params['shop']}"
                       env['omniauth.strategy'].options[:client_options][:site] = site_url
                     }
    end
