          close-issue-message: |
            We are closing this issue because it has been inactive for a few months. 
            This probably means that it is not reproducible or it has been fixed in a newer version. 
            If it’s an enhancement and hasn’t been taken on since it was submitted, then it seems other issues have taken priority.

            If you still encounter this issue with the latest stable version, please reopen using the issue template. You can also contribute directly by submitting a pull request– see the CONTRIBUTING.md(.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines

            Thank you!
