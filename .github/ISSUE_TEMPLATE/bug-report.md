Authentication Issues: A great deal of the issues surrounding this repo are around authenticating (installing) the generated app with Shopify.

If you are experiencing issues with your app authenticating/installing the best way to get help fast is to create a repo with the minimal amount of code to demonstrate the issue and a clearly documented set of steps you took to arrive there. This will help us solve your problem quicker since we won't need to spend any time figuring out how to reproduce the bug. Please also include your operating system and browser.
