Make sure to set the Application URL of the application your Shopify partner account 
to <tt>http://localhost:3000/login</tt>.

Then, start your application with:

  $ rails server

Now visit http://localhost:3000 and install your application in a Shopify store.

After your application has been given read or read/write API permission by the
shop, you're ready to start experimenting with the Shopify API.
