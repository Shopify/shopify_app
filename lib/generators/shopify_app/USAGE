Description:
    This is a generator for creating a basic Shopify application to quickly get
    you started. You can see some examples on how to use the Shopify API.
    
    The generator creates a basic sessions controller for authenticating with your
    Shop and a controller called "home" which displays basic information 
    about your products, orders and articles.
    
    Note: It's recommended to use this on a new Rails project, so that the 
          generator won't overwrite/delete some of your files.

Usage:
    Pass your API key and then your Secret, which the sessions controller 
    will need to authenticate with your shop. 
    If you don't have an API key yet, register your application in our
    partner system at http://www.shopify.com/partners

    
Examples:
    script/generate shopify_app edffbb1bb793e2750686e6f4647a384a abbcee050...
        
    This will create a sessions controller and a home controller and views.
